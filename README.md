# NASA Photo of the Day
This projects works with the NASA API to deliver different photos depending on the day you choose. There is also a slideshow option.

## How It's Made:
**Tech used:** HTML, CSS, JavaScript

This was an opportunity to make fetch requests and filter arrays of objects. There is something about handling data that can be so exciting. I also chose to ignore the built in Date methods in JavaScript and built my own function for going back one day at a time with a time delay. At the click of a button, the value of the input is captured and sent of as a query parameter to NASA. The results returned are then picked through to display the photo, description, and the title of the photo. 

## Optimizations

I would love to go back and style this project. I feel like the logical components are very exciting, but I also like things that look cool. You can see from my other projects that I like to make things attractive to the eye, and this is one of the projects that could use a fresh coat of paint.

## Lessons Learned:

I learned a lot about arrays, objects, fetch, http requests, query parameters, recursive functions, and so much more. I really tried to push myself to not use the normal methods for solving the usual problems. I feel like they work well, and I will carry this into my future projects.

## Examples:
